		<i> My Name is Swapna. I am from Jeeedimakula Palli. I have completed my degree in sri vani degree college.<br>
		    Now I am in boot camp in bangalore.<br> I am learning coding to become a full stack web developer. <br>
		    I am the eldest child in my family , I have four siblings, two sisters and two brothers.<br>
		    I want to help my father by providing economic support.<br>
		    My father is a very strong person, he is my inspiration.<br>
		    He teaches me how to face problems.<br>
		    When I am feeling low then he supports me and helps me to overcome those situations by telling motivations.<br>
		    When I feel very low, if I talk with my father I feel somewhat better. He is my hero.<br>
		    MY FATHER NAME IS GOVINDAIAH.
